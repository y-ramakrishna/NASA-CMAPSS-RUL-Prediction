RUL prediction using BiLSTM on NASA C-MAPSS FD001 dataset

# NASA-CMAPSS-RUL-Prediction

This project predicts the **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** of aircraft engines using a Bidirectional LSTM model on the  ASA C-MAPSS FD001 dataset.


 Features

1. BiLSTM-based deep learning model
2. Sliding window time-series approach
3. Robust training using Huber Loss
4. GroupKFold cross-validation by engine ID
5. Final model achieves **MAE < 10 cycles**

 Final Result

Final MAE:9.77 cycles  
Test Set: FD001 subset of NASA C-MAPSS dataset

 Model Architecture

1.Bidirectional LSTM (128 → 64)
2.Dropout & BatchNormalization layers
3.Dense layers with ReLU activation
4.Huber Loss + Adam Optimizer
5.EarlyStopping and ReduceLROnPlateau callbacks
